"""
Workflow Router Module.

Provides a lightweight mechanism to register and run asynchronous workflows
by name. Each workflow is stored with its accepted parameters and any fixed
keyword arguments, ensuring that only relevant arguments are passed at runtime.

Main components:
    - WorkflowSpec: Encapsulates a workflow function, fixed arguments, and
      cached accepted parameter names.
    - WorkflowRouter: Registry and dispatcher for workflows, allowing dynamic
      execution by string key.

class WorkflowSpec:

    Specification for a workflow function.

    Stores:
      - The workflow coroutine to call.
      - Any fixed keyword arguments that should always be passed.
      - A cached set of accepted parameter names for efficient filtering.

    Attributes:
        func (Callable[..., Awaitable[None]]): The async function implementing the workflow.
        fixed_kwargs (Dict[str, Any]): Keyword arguments fixed at registration time.
        accepted_params (Set[str]): Cached set of parameter names the workflow function accepts.

    Router for registering and running workflows by name.

    Allows:
      - Registering async workflows under a string key.
      - Supplying fixed arguments at registration time (e.g., system prompts).
      - Running workflows later with runtime arguments, where only the
        parameters accepted by the workflow function are passed. This means
        you can pass all possible services in, and only the required services will be used.
